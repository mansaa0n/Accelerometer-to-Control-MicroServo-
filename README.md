# Accelerometer-to-Control-MicroServo-
This python code can be used on the Micropython PYB1.1. The built-in accelerometer will control the micro servo movements and directions

Use GPIO to connect the MicroServo
the accelerometer sensor is already built-in it is imported in the code already.
Use X1 as the PWM input to the servo.
